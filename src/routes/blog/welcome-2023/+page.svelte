<h1>Welcome 2023</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>
	2022 was a trying time for a lot of people, myself included. I moved states, might as well have
	been countries. What characterized this year is that we all wake up.

<h3>Special Thanks</h3>

<p>Without a doubt I would not have been able to make it through this year without your help.</p>
